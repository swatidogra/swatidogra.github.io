The models were evaluated using metrics like ROC AUC scores, with Logistic Regression. Findings indicate that accurate prediction of product ratings can enhance consumer satisfaction, aid brands in improving products, and maintain market competitiveness. Recommendations include further feature engineering, model tuning, and exploring advanced algorithms to refine predictions and personalize recommendations.</li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/swatidogra/DS-Projects/tree/main/Predictive%20Sales%20Forecasting%20for%20E-Commerce%20Platforms%20Using%20Advanced%20Data%20Science%20Techniques">Predictive Sales Forecasting for E-Commerce Platforms Using Advanced Data Science Techniques</a> - Predicting future sales is crucial for inventory management, marketing strategies, and financial planning on e-commerce platforms. Accurate sales forecasting helps optimize stock levels, reduce costs, plan marketing campaigns, and enhance customer satisfaction by considering peak seasons and hours. By leveraging advanced data science techniques, such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), businesses can gain valuable insights into sales patterns. This project aims to predict sales using historical data, sourced from Kaggle, which includes features such as product category, price, order date, and sales, ultimately improving resource allocation, pricing strategies, and overall profitability.</li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/swatidogra/DS-Projects/tree/main/Advanced%20Travel%20Recommendation%20System%20Using%20Data%20Science%20Techniques">Advanced Travel Recommendation System Using Data Science Techniques</a> - This project aims to create a travel recommendation system using data from flat files, APIs, and websites, recommending hotels, tours, and attractions based on user preferences and location. The project involves data preprocessing, integration, and visualization. Key challenges include ensuring data quality and consistency, handling varying data volumes, and building a scalable database. Ethical considerations involve addressing potential biases in hotel reviews and ensuring the fairness of the recommendations. Data science techniques used include data cleansing, standardization, and visualization to derive actionable insights for travel recommendations.</li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/swatidogra/DS-Projects/tree/main/Analyzing%20and%20Predicting%20Trends%20in%20the%20Electric%20Vehicle%20Industry%20Using%20Data%20Science%20Techniques">Analyzing and Predicting Trends in the Electric Vehicle Industry Using Data Science Techniques</a> - This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle Population dataset from Kaggle to uncover insights that can inform decision-making in the electric vehicle sector. Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and predictive modeling, the study reveals trends in EV growth, popular makes and models, and the distribution of different types of EVs. By forecasting future trends, the project aims to support informed decision-making for consumers and stakeholders. While limitations exist, the analysis provides a strong foundation for further research and real-world applications in promoting electric vehicle adoption.</li>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/swatidogra/DS-Projects/tree/main/Comprehensive%20Analysis%20of%20Pregnancy%20and%20Birth%20Outcomes%20Using%20NSFG%20Data">Comprehensive Analysis of Pregnancy and Birth Outcomes Using NSFG Data</a> - This project involves analyzing the NSFG dataset to uncover insights related to pregnancy and birth. Key variables analyzed include age during pregnancy, birth order, pregnancy length, total birth weight, and birth weight for live births. The project includes creating histograms to visualize data distribution, examining potential correlations between variables using scatter plots, and performing regression analysis. Through exploratory data analysis and statistical methods, the project aims to understand central tendencies, variability, and relationships within the dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing pregnancy and birth outcomes.</li>
